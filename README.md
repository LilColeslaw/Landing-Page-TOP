# Landing-Page-TOP
The landing page project from The Odin Project (TOP)

In this project I made a web page complete with CSS and HTML. In it I demonstrated my new knowledge of CSS and especially of Flexbox. The webpage I made was of a 
format that is extremely common, so this project prepared me well for future work I will do.
